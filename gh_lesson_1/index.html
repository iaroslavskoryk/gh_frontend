			<h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
			<p>HTML stands for <span>HyperText Markup Language</span>. Hypertext means "text with links in it." Any time you click on a word that brings you to a new webpage, you've clicked on hypertext! A markup language is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on a page: it can turn text into images, links, tables, lists, and much more. HTML is the markup language we'll be learning.</p>
			<p>What makes webpages pretty? That's CSS - <span>Cascading Style Sheets</span>. Think of it like skin and makeup that covers the bones of HTML.</p>
